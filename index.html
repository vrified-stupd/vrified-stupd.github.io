        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Theo, I like to code and tinker with computers. I mainly code in C/C++ but I also know Python and C#.</p>
        <h3>How long have I been coding?</h3>
        <p>I have been coding since I was 9. I am self-taught and just learned from coding documentations.</p>
        <h3>Am I open to collaboration?</h3>
        <p>No, I am still learning other languages like JS so I probably cannot qualify with what you are doing.</p>
        <h3>What can I do?</h3>
        <p>CLI applications, Desktop applications, Kernel Development, PC Repair, and PC building.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aside from programming, I also have an interest for Computer Engineering. It's what I plan on taking as my course when I enter college.</p>
